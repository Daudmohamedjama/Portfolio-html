But most of my growing-up years happened in Hargeisa,</br> the capital of Somaliland. I proudly graduated from Salama Secondary School.</br> I'm currently living in Turkey, specifically in Sakarya City.</br> Right now, I'm just a student, doing my first degree at Sakarya University,</br> specializing in Business Administration at the School of Business.</br> I'm super into learning and I'm hoping to turn all this education into a </br>cool career in the business world someday!"</p>
