            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
    <p>"Hey there,</br> I'm Daud Mohamed Jama. I'm full stack web and app developer</br> I originally come from the beautiful landscapes of Somalia,</br> born in a city called Erigabo. But most of my growing-up years happened in Hargeisa,</br> the capital of Somaliland. I proudly graduated from Salama Secondary School.</br> I'm currently living in Turkey, specifically in Sakarya City.</br> Right now, I'm just a student, doing my first degree at Sakarya University,</br> specializing in Business Administration at the School of Business.</br> I'm super into learning and I'm hoping to turn all this education into a </br>cool career in the business world someday!"</p>
